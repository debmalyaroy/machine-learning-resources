## Principles and Rules
- Principle of least priviledge - Requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a computing environment, every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose
- Peter principle - The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role
    + Employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "managers rise to the level of their incompetence."
- Pareto principle
    + 20% of the features will account for 80% of the value
    + 20% of the work will produce 80% of the value
- Ninety/Ninety Rule
    + The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time. (180% of time)
- SUCCESs - Made to stick principles
    + Simplicity
    + Unexpectedness
    + Concreteness
    + Credibility
    + Emotions
    + Stories
- Build, measure, learn
    + Maximize learning through incremental and iterative engineering
    + Build relates to MVP, ie, the simplest product to show customers to get most learning at that time
    + Goal is always to maximize learning and not build fully featured beta/prototype
    + Lean startup version: hypothesis, design experiments, test, insight

## Laws
- Parkinson's law of triviality - Members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues
- Parkinson's law - Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- Brooks's law - Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
- Hofstadter's law - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law
- Little's law - The long-term average number of customers in a stable system L is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate, λ, multiplied by the (Palm‑)average time a customer spends in the system, W; or expressed algebraically: L = λW.
