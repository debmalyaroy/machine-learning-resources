<h2><a name="methodologies">Product Development Methodologies List</a></h2>

- Agile/SCRUM
    + Alternatives
        * Disciplined agile delivery (DAD)
        * Agile model driven development (AMDD)
- Scaled agile framework (SAFe)
- Kanban
- Scrumban
- Lean
- Outcome-driven innovation (ODI) and 'jobs to be done' (JTBD)
- Waterfall
- Extreme programming (XP)
- Spiral

<h2><a name="agilevals">Agile Values</a></h2>

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation                    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

<h2><a name="manifesto">Agile Manifesto Principles</a></h2>

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

**Kanban**

- Principles
    + Visualize workflow
    + Create flow and pull
    + Balance demand against throughput
    + Limit WIP
    + Target lead time with performance metric
    + Continuous improvement
    + Class of service
- Benefits
    + Flow-driven, pull system, balance demand and throuput
        + Allows for 'just in time' and more focused delivery of work
        + Less multitasking and context switching
        + Reduces wasted time (parkinsons as well)
    + Not everything requires estimates and deadlines
    + Front-loading not optimimal, and oftern arbitrary
    + Continuous improvement and reprioritization, not fixed methodology
    + More flexible process-wise, quickly adapt to new information and needs
    + Emphasized continous delivery
    + Increased productivity and efficiency
        + Increased output
- Characteristics
    + Class of service (CoD: cost of delay-based)
    + Work in progress (WIP) limits
    + Target date with performance metric

**Lean** 

- Principles
    + Kaizen
    + Build, measure, learn
    + Fail fast and often
    + Maximize customer value while minimizing waste
    + Create flow and establish pull
    + Minimum viable product (MVP)
    + Minimum lovable product (MLP)
    + Minimum marketable feature (MMF)
