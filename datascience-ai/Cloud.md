## Cloud Goals
- Consolidation
- Resource pooling
- Scalability and large workload handling
- Redundancy
- Failover
- Programmability and orchestration
- Utility computing - _pay as you go_
- Mixed workloads
- Rapid elasticity
- Networking
- Multi-tenancy and workload isolation

## Cloud Computing Functions
- Data storage (block or object storage)
- Data processing (compute resources)
- Data interchange (networking)

## Cloud Components
- Data storage
    + Disk attached storage (DAS) - block storage
        * No RAID
        * JBOD - _just a box of disks_
    + Object storage
        * Primary or _boot_ storage
        * Secondary or _object_ storage
