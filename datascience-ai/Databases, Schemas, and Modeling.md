## Database Considerations and Tradeoffs
- ACID
    + Atomicity - An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible series of database operations such that either all occur, or nothing occurs
    + Consistency - The requirement that any given database transaction must change affected data only in allowed ways, and that any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof
    + Isolation - How transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems, i.e., how/when the changes made by one operation become visible to other
    + Durability - Guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently
- BASE
    + Basically Available - Any data request should receive a response, but that response may indicate a failure or changing state as opposed to the requested data
    + Soft state - Given eventual consistency, the system may be in a changing state until consistency is reached
    + Eventual consistency - Informally guarantees that (to achieve high availability), if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value
- CAP (Brewers theorem) and PACELC
    + Consistency - All clients always have the same view of the data
    + Availability - Each client can always read and write
    + Partition tolerance - The system works well despite physical network partitions
- Consistency vs eventually consistency
- Speed and performance
- Locks
    + Lock contention
    + Long term blocking
    + Database deadlocks
    + System deadlocks
- Schema on write vs schema on read
- Isolation levels
    + Serializable
    + Repeatable reads
    + Read committed
    + Read uncommitted
- Isolation-related read phenomena
    + Dirty reads
    + Non-repeatable reads
    + Phantom reads
- Concurrency control
- Different read types (e.g., dirty, non-repeatable, phantom, ...)

## Databases by CAP (non-exhaustive)
- CA - Typically deal with P with replication
    + RDBMS
- AP - Achieve "eventual consistency" through replication and verification
    + Dynamo
    + Voldemort
    + Cassandra
    + SimpleDB
    + CouchDB
    + Riak
- CP - Have trouble with availability while keeping data consistent across partitioned nodes
    + BigTable
    + MongoDB
    + HBase
    + MemcacheDB
    + Redis

## Database, data warehouse, and Analytical Terminology
+ Dimension (e.g., customer, product, ...)
    * Data must vary to be considered a dimension
        - E.g., Analysis of sales of a single product, product not considered a dimension in this case. Analysis of sales across many products, product is considered a dimension.
    * Types
        - Conformed
        - Junk
        - Degenerate
        - Role-playing
+ Fact - A value or measurement
+ Measures (e.g., sales) - Facts
    * Types
        - Additive
        - Non-additive
        - Semi-additive
+ Data element
    * An element of data representation that helps form a data model
+ Data structure
    * A particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
    * [Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)
+ OLAP - Online analytical processing
    * Associated with OLAP data, tools, data storage, and querying 
    * Types
        - Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP)
        - Relational OLAP (ROLAP)
        - Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP)
        - Real-Time OLAP (RTOLAP)
+ OLAP Cube
    * A multi-dimensional array of data or multi-dimensional dataset
        - Pivoting (spreadsheet analysis) done via holding dimensions constant and leaving two dimensions to analyze
        - Associated with analytical operations (shown below)
+ OLTP - Online transaction processing
+ Operational database
        * Sometimes synonymous with OLTP systems
        * Wikipedia
            - Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in real-time.
            - Operational databases are used to store, manage and track real-time business information.
            - An operational database stores information about the activities of an organization, for example customer relationship management transactions or financial operations, in a computer database.
            - A Database which is accessed by an operational system (e.g., the application used by the customer service department) to carry out regular operations of an organization. Operational databases usually use an OLTP database which is optimized for faster transaction processing (create, read, update and delete operations).
+ CRUD - Create, read, update, delete
+ Multidimensional analysis - Data dimensions and measurements
+ Analytical operations
    * Consolidation (roll-up)
    * Drill-down/up - new cube with one dimension the subset of the original cube's parent dimension
    * Slicing - filtering data across a dimension(s), i.e., reduce the cubes dimension by one by selecting a single value for one dimension
    * Dicing - grouping data and reducing cube size, i.e., creating a subcube
    * Pivot - rotate the cube for different perspective of the data
+ Structured vs semi-structured vs unstructured data
    * Structured
        - Highly organized data that is well suited for relational database and/or data table storage
    * Semi-structured
        - Wikipedia: A form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data
        - Examples
            + JSON
            + XML
    * Unstructured
        - Wikipedia: Information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner
        - Examples
            + Text (documents, email body, web page body, books, ...)
            + Audio
            + Video
            + Analog data
            + Images
            + Files

## Database Design
- Wide vs narrow data, or stacked vs un-stacked
    + Wide (unstacked): Every feature in a separate column
    + Narrow (stacked): Single feature column with all values (e.g., categorical), with another column containing corresponding values
- Entity vs event data
    + Entity: One table per entity and normalized, but requires lots of tables and joins for analytics
    + Event: JSON a good format, denormalized, nested, and schemaless
- Transactional (OLTP) vs analytical (OLAP) database/data store
    + OLTP: Simple queries, large volume, focus on transactions and transaction processing, CRUD-optimized
    + OLAP: Complex analytical queries, rapid execution, focus on business intelligence and analytics, read-optimized
- Table types
    + Dimension table
    + [Fact table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_table#Types_of_fact_tables)
        * Contain foreign keys of related dimension tables
        * Primary key usually a composite key of its foreign keys 
        * Types
            - Transactional
            - Periodic snapshots
            - Accumulating snapshots
            - Temporal snapshots
- Data warehouse and analytical schemas
    + Star
        * Best for data marts
        * One or more fact tables referencing any number of denormalized single-dimension tables
        * Simple and fast to query
        * More difficult to maintain
    + Reverse star
    + Snowflake
        * Best for data warehouses
        * One or more fact tables referencing any number of normalized dimension tables (i.e., one or multiple tables per dimension)
        * Reduces redundancy, size, and storage, also helps referential integrity
        * Slower and more complex to query, particularly due to complex queries and often required joins
        * Easier to maintain
    + Fact constellation
    + Galaxy
- Normal forms
    + First Normal Form (1NF)
        * Wikipedia: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
    + Second Normal Form (2NF)
        * Wikipedia: A table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and every non-prime attribute of the table is dependent on the whole of every candidate key.
    + Third Normal Form (3NF) - If met, a DB is considered 'Normalized'
        * Wikipedia: A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all the attributes in a table are determined only by the candidate keys of that table and not by any non-prime attributes
    + Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
